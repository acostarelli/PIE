Notes:
- how the design works: disk that pans around, arm coming out of the base
holds ir sensor looking at disk. ir is mounted on tilt that can look up and
down at the object on the pan. the pan gear needs to 1:2 so the plate gets
360 degrees of rotation
- i feel like the arduino code should be as simple as possible

Assumptions:
- pan servo is geared 1:2
- 0 degrees for the tilt is pointing straight up (might not matter)
